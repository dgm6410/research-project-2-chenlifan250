Project 2: Cartoon Shader

Description: 
Cartoon shader can render objects in a cartoon style. No texture map or normal map needed. It's very easy to use.
The shader is written by myself but not my original idea, as I just followed the guide from a book.

Feature:
- the objects are rendered in cartoon style by a shader I wrote
- the camera can be controlled
